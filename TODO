Needed:
	frontend
	spinning trx logo
	resolve all TODOs into the code (better performance/logging)
	production dockerfile/compose (todo post frontend)

Useful:
	colorful/better logs
	config reloader (hot realod of config file || button to reload)
	api/button to delete/remove the flag queue
	api/button to send flags, instead of waiting the timer
	can take startup flags to change options (like config.json path)

Not so needed but game changing:
	beep when errors || ping on telegram/discord as bot
	maybe better flagids store/retrive
	client rewrite
	client option to submit directly to gameserver
	load balancer
